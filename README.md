# British Columbia Ungauged Basin Dataset

## Introduction

To support research in streamflow monitoring network optimization, we need a dataset to represent the set of possible monitoring locations.  The British Columbia Ungauged Basin (BCUB) dataset is intended to represent an approximate decision space for the optimization problem.  

This repository contains the codebase used to generate the dataset.  Users may find a [condensed results file]() containing basin pour point coordinates and basin attributes, or may use any of the [sub-region polygons provided] to derive the sample for some or all of the study region.  A [detailed example]() is provided in the form of a Jupyter book to demonstrate the full process on a smaller region, Vancouver Island.

See the [README.md under `setup_scripts/`](https://github.com/dankovacek/bcub/tree/main/setup_scripts) for setup of the validation scripting.
