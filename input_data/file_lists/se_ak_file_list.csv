USGS National Hydrography Dataset Best Resolution (NHD) for Hydrological Unit (HU) 8 - 19010102 (published 20231220) FileGDB,The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD generally developed at 1:24000/1:12000 scale adds detail to the original 1:100000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution not 1:100000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features flow direction names and centerline representations for areal water bodies.
